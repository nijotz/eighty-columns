A simple vim plugin for toggling the coloring of the 80 column limit.  This was
in my vimrc, but thought I'd pull it out to a plugin share with others.  Just
drop this in the bundle directory if you have pathogen. Otherwise, the contents
of eighty-cols.vim can simply be placed in vimrc.

<Leader>80 toggles coloring of every column after 80

The plugin assumes you're using 256 colors and are using a dark theme as it
uses a dark grey for the background.
